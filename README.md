# Rare-Sneakers-Store-MVP
Populating the cart with data and ready for backend integration.

I will soon make this fully functional but I began with the cart functionality and
populating the frontend with data first since it makes everything easier during backend integration.

I also need to clear the cart when the "proceed to checkout" button is clicked and scroll over to the 
featured products when the "Shop now" button is clicked.

This is just an MVP. Feel free to contribute where you see fit as well?
